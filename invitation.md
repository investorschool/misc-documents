Dear (**Founder Name**),

I am happy to invite you to pitch (**Company Name**) at our angel investor meetup on (**June 28**) in (**Palo Alto**). The group's attendance numbers tend to be modest, and we generally expect 20 to 30 angels.

The standard agenda of the group is: refreshments and mingling, 30 minutes of comments from a prominent speaker, five startups pitching for two minutes each, and then a bit more mingling. 

We will have a computer and projector in the room, so presenting a few slides is possible. We will use the same computer for all pitches, so host any slides online via an unlisted link on Google Slides or similar service. You will be one of five startups at the event, and so far at every event there has been plenty of time for the startups to meet with the angels. Limit your pitch to two minutes.

Here is a link with event and RSVP information.

The event may be livestreamed, though we can arrange to exclude your pitch from the broadcast if you prefer.

Please confirm your attendance by return email, and contact me if you have questions. 

As the event nears, if you need to phone or text me, my cell is (**(xxx) xxx-xxxx**). We look forward to meeting you and learning more about (**Company Name**) in a couple of weeks!

Best,  
Alan Glennon
