Dear (**Founder Name**),

I am happy to invite you to pitch (**Company Name**) at our angel investor meetup on (**June 28**) in (**Palo Alto**). The group's attendance numbers tend to be modest, and we generally expect 20 to 30 angels.

The standard agenda of the group tends to be: refreshments and mingling, 30 minutes or so of comments from a prominent speaker, five startups pitching at two minutes each, and then a bit more mingling. 

We plan to have a computer and projector in the room, so showing a few slides is possible if you wish. We would prefer not to switch out computers between startups, so try to host them online via an unlisted link on Google Slides or similar service. You will be one of five startups at the event, and so far at every event there has been plenty of time for the startups to meet and mingle with the angels. Please limit your pitch to two minutes.

Here's a link with event and RSVP information.

The event may be livestreamed, though we can arrange to exclude your pitch from that if you prefer.

Please confirm your attendance by return email, and also feel free to contact me if you have questions. 

As the event nears, if you need to phone or text me, my cell is (**(xxx) xxx-xxxx**). I am looking forward to meeting you and learning more about (**Company Name**) in a couple of weeks!

Best,  
Alan Glennon
